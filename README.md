# 🚀 Advanced Algorithm Performance Analyzer

A production-ready benchmarking tool built in Python to analyze and compare the performance of multiple sorting algorithms on large datasets.

This project demonstrates strong understanding of algorithm design, time complexity analysis, and performance optimization.

---

## 📌 Overview

Advanced Algorithm Performance Analyzer benchmarks different sorting algorithms on datasets of up to 100,000 elements and compares their execution times in a structured output format.

The project follows a modular architecture separating algorithm implementations from benchmarking logic.
